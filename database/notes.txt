--> I have an issue with Eddie Murphy last_name showing \tmurphy in json data
Remove leading space with: 

    UPDATE actor
    SET last_name = LTRIM(last_name)
    WHERE actor_id = 123;

Remove any leading/trailing whitespace: 

    UPDATE actor
    SET last_name = TRIM(last_name)
    WHERE actor_id = 123;

Check for any bad whitespace in sql code:

    SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name
    FROM actor
    WHERE last_name != TRIM(last_name);

Inspect the bytes to determine what the whitespace is:

    SELECT
      actor_id,
      CONCAT(">", last_name, "<") AS shown,
      LENGTH(last_name) AS bytes_length,
      CHAR_LENGTH(last_name) AS chars_length,
      HEX(SUBSTRING(last_name, 1, 1)) AS first_byte_hex,
      HEX(last_name) AS full_hex
    FROM actor
    WHERE actor_id = 123;

    --> returned ( 09 ) which means 'tab' <--
        --> ( 20 ) is normal space
        --> ( A0 ) non-breaking space

SOLUTION: 
    --> ( 09 ) tab: 
    UPDATE actor
    SET last_name = REPLACE(last_name, CHAR(9), '')
    WHERE actor_id = 123;

VERIFY CLEANUP
    SELECT actor_id, CONCAT(">", last_name, "<") AS shown, LENGTH(last_name), HEX(last_name)
    FROM actor
    WHERE actor_id = 123;

BEST SOLUTION MySQL 8+ remove any leading/trailing whitespace (tabs/newlines/ect.):
    UPDATE actor
    SET last_name = REGEXP_REPLACE(last_name, '^[[:space:]]+|[[:space:]]+$', '')
    WHERE actor_id = 123;
or for the whole table:
    UPDATE actor
    SET last_name = REGEXP_REPLACE(last_name, '^[[:space:]]+|[[:space:]]+$', '');
